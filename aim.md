Mass spectroscopy is the most accurate analytical tool to weigh the molar masses of a given molecule. The principle consists of ionizing the sample in the gas phase to form positively charged ion or radical ions and then measure the mass to charge ratio of all ions. It is largely used in Industry and Academia and finds application in Chemistry, Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical, Environmental, Clinical, Geological fields. Different methods use different techniques for ionization which in turn determines what types of samples can be analyzed by mass spectrometry. Of all available methods, Electron Ionisation or Impact mass spectroscopy is the most widely used.

This experiment's aim is Introduction to Mass Spectrometry Instrumentation and interpretation of Mass Spectra.
