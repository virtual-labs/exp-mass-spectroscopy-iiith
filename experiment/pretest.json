      "question": "1. Which of the following statement is false for mass spectroscopy?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Mass spectroscopy is used to identify unknown compounds within a sample, and to elucidate the structure and chemical properties of different molecules",
        "b": "Particles are characterized by their mass to charge ratios (m/z) and relative abundances",
        "c": "This technique basically studies the effect of ionizing energy on molecules",
        "d": "This technique can be used on all states of matter"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Mass spectroscopy like other techniques helps in identifying unknown compounds.",
        "b": "Mass to Charge ratio is a key component to identify any molecule.",
        "c": "By ionising the molecule and the consequent behaviour of the molecule, it studies the effect that ionizing energy has on the molecule.",
        "d": "This theory studies the effect of ionization on the molecule when accelerated through vacuum, for this purpose only the gaseous state of molecules can be studied."

      "question": "2. Which of the following main components of mass spectroscopy deal with resolving the ions into their characteristic mass components according to their mass-to-charge ratio?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Ion Source",
        "b": "Analyzer",
        "c": "Detector System",
        "d": "Analyzer tube"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "In a mass spectrometer a sample is ionized in an ion source and the resulting ions are separated by their mass-to-charge ratio.",
        "b": "The complete process involves the conversion of the sample into gaseous ions, with or without fragmentation, which is then characterized by their mass to charge ratios (m/z) by an analyser. Eventually, the second analyzer will analyse fragment the selected ions and detect the ions emerging from the last analyzer and measure their relative abundances with the detector that converts the ions into electrical signals.",
        "c": "The ions are detected by the detector system and the results are displayed as spectra of the relative abundance of detected ions as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio.",
        "d": "Analyzer tube is a flight tube which is used to measure TOF (time of flight) through it in a type of analyzer known as TOF mass analyser."

      "question": "3. In mass spectrometer, the ions are sorted out in which of the following ways?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By accelerating them through electric field",

        "c": "By accelerating them through electric and magnetic field",

      "question": "4. Which species would get deflected by the greatest degree in the mass spectrometer?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "<sup>12</sup>C<sup>+</sup>",

        "c": "<sup>13</sup>C<sup>2+</sup>",
        "d": "<sup>14</sup>C<sup>+</sup>"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Higher the m/z ratio, more is the deflection. For <sup>12</sup>C<sup>+</sup> is 12.",
        "b": "m/z ratio is 13",
        "c": "m/z ratio is 6.5",
        "d": "m/z ratio is 14. Hence due to the highest m/z ratio, this ion would be deflected the most"
