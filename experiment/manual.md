Follow the procedure given below:

Step1: Click on 'Load Sample'

Observe: The sample is introduced into the vaporisation chamber which is instantly vapourised due to high vacuum and heat.

Step 2: Click on 'Ionisation'

Observe: Positively charged radical ions are formed by bombardment of beam of high energy electrons.

Step 3:Click on 'Accelaration'

Observe: The positively charged radical ions are accelerated by perforated negative electrodes.

Step 4: Click on 'Deflection'

Observe: The ions are sorted and separted by the magnetic field according to their mass/ charge ratio.

Step 5:Click on 'Evaluation'

oObserve:Takes one to a new page where one needs to analyse the mass spectrum.
