The magnetic sector mass analysis: The kinetic energy of an accelarated ion imparted by the voltage V is:

    	     [image1](images/eq11.png)
	     
where m is the mass of the ion, v is its velocity and z is the charge. When the ions pass through the two poles of a magent, the charged particles take a curve path. The radius of curvature (r) of this path is:

where B is the magnetic field strength.
Combining the above two equations:

Greater the value of m/z value larger is the radius of the curved path. The analyser tube has a fixed radius of curvature and the magnetic field strength is varied such that all the ions reach the detector.

The mass spectrometer consist of five important componenets:

a. Sample inlet: Here the sample under study is introduced into the chamber and the pressure inside the sample inlet is much lower than the outside pressure. A stream of molecules is produced here.

b. Ion Source: The stream of molecules undergo ionisation by various methods. Different compounds are ionised by different methods. This includes: Electron Ionisation(EI), Chemical Ionisation (CI), Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), Fast Atom Bombardment (FAB) and Matrix Desorption Ionisation (MALDI)

c. Mass Analyser: Saparates the compound based on their mass to charge ratio (m/z).

d. Detector: The ions that are deflected under the magnetic field are detected by the detector.

e. Output: The siganl is then recorded and processed by the data system. The output is the mass spectrum.

**Electron Ionisation method:**

In all the mass spectrometers regardsless of the method used to determine the mass-to-charge ratio of a molecule/compound, first the sample has to enter the mass spectrometer, then converted to charge particle by ion source before there are deflected by the magnetic field and detected. In EI-MS a beam of high energy electrons stike the incoming molecules. The electron and the molecules collide and the molecules form cationss. A repleeer plate that carries a positive electrical potential directs the newly created ions towards a series of accelaration plates. A large potetial difference (1 to 10 KV) is applied across these plates to produce a beam of positive ions. There is a repeller plate that absorbs any negative ions. Molecules that are not ionised are drwan off by the vacuum. Most of the molecules or atoms require 8 to 15 electron colts to get ionised. But usually the beam of electrons stike the molecules at 50 to 70 eV. For recording a simple proton NMR spectra deuterated solvents especially for the use of NMR are used.

Salient features of EI method:

1. Basic and well understood ionisation method

2. Ideal for all volatile compounds with masses less than 1000.

3. Leads to molecular ion fragmentation, fragmentation provides structural information.

4. Mass spectra are reproducible.
